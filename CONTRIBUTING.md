This document is intended to provide some guidance to those wondering how and whether they should make changes to this repository. We do welcome your input! Please see and abide by the [code of conduct](https://github.com/bwiernik/Classroom/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when contributing. 

As a general rule, please submit changes as a pull request. If you'd like to make a change that isn't small, it would be wise to contact the instructor of the course (`@bwiernik`) to pass the idea by them.

The instructor of the course will typically be committing to `master`, since they'll need to make changes often during the course.
