- Asking questions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of today's class, you will be able to:

- Distinguish and navigate between GitHub repositories, Organization accounts, 
  and user accounts.
- Edit plain text files on GitHub.
- Navigate the commit history of a repository and a file on GitHub.
- Contribute to GitHub Issues, especially for this class.
- Identify whether a software-related question has a reproducible example.

## Resources

If you want to learn more about today's topics, check out:

- The [GitHub guide](https://guides.github.com/) has lots of info about GitHub. 
  If you do go here, I recommend you start with 
  ["Hello, World!"](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). You'll 
  see stuff about branching there -- we'll be discussing that next week.
- Dr. Jenny Bryan's ["How to get unstuck"](https://wiernik-datasci.netlify.com/help-general/) 
  page is useful for getting help online.

## Topic 2: GitHub (35 min)

(2 min)

We will be using [GitHub](https://github.com) a lot in this course:

- All course-related work will go on GitHub.
- Discussion will happen on GitHub.
- Class materials are on GitHub.

But why GitHub? Because it's tremendously effective for developing a project. Examples:

- [Apple](https://github.com/apple) uses it.
- [Uber](https://github.com/uber) uses it.
- [Netflix](https://github.com/Netflix) uses it.
- [This Guidebook](https://github.com/USF-Psych-DataSci/Classroom) and [the class website](https://github.com/USF-Psych-DataSci/DataSci-home) use it.
- Prominent R packages like [`ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) use it. 

Today, we'll check out:

1. GitHub as cloud storage;
2. GitHub for collaboration; and
3. GitHub for version control with git.

### Register a GitHub account - Activity (4 min)

Your turn:

1. Register for a free account on [github.com](https://github.com). 
    - You'll be using this account for the duration of the course.
    - Give your username [some thought](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice) -- ideally, should include your name.
2. Tell me what your username is by filling out [this survey](https://usf.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8kAdI0XraWU6geN).

### GitHub as cloud storage (4 min)

At the very least, GitHub allows for cloud storage, like Google Drive and Dropbox do. There's a bit more structure than just storing files under your account:

- __Repositories (aka "repo")__: All files must be organized into _repositories_. Think of these as self-contained projects. These can either be _public_ or _private_.
- __User Accounts__ vs. __Organization Accounts (aka "Org")__: All repositories belong to an account:
    - A _user account_ is the account you just made, and typically holds repositories related to your own work. 
    - An _Organization_ account can be owned by multiple people, and typically holds repositories relevant to a group (like STAT 545).

Examples: 

- The [`ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) repo, within its corresponding `tidyverse` Org. 
- My [website](https://github.com/bwiernik/wiernik_org) repo, within my own user account.

Want to read more about GitHub accounts? [Check out this help page on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/types-of-github-accounts).

### GitHub as cloud storage - Activity (10 min)

__Together: Make a participation repo__

- Follow the [setup instructions](https://wiernik-datasci.netlify.com/evaluation/participation/#setup) on the participation page. 

__Navigating GitHub__

1. Together: Make a new file on your participation repository:
    - Click on the "Create New File" button on your repository's home page.
    - Call it `navigating_github.md`
    - Leave it blank, and commit ("save") the file by clicking on green "commit new file" button at the bottom of the page.
2. Together: Add the following URL's to your `navigating_github.md` file (click on the pen button to edit), together with some commentary:
    - The repository for the class home page, called `DataSci-home` (use this if the site ever goes down!)
    - The account it's under.
    - Whether the account is a _user account_ or an _Org_.
3. Together: Commit the changes.
4. Your turn: Continue the exercise, and add more URL's (with more commentary):
    - The URL to your participation repo
    - The URL to your user account page
5. Your turn: Commit the changes.

### GitHub for collaboration (4 min)

The "traditional" way to collaborate involves sending files over email. Problems:

- Easily lose track of who has the most recent version.
- Emails get buried.

Addressed by GitHub:

- GitHub repository treated as the "master version".
- Use [_GitHub Issues_](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) instead of email.

_Issues_ are a discussion board corresponding to a particular repository. One "thread" is called an Issue. Some features:

- Tag other GitHub users using `@username`.
- Get email notifications if you are tagged, or are `Watch`ing a repository.

As an example, check out the Issues in the [`ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) repository.

More on collaboration next Thursday.

### GitHub for collaboration - Activity (1 min)

__Together: `Watch`ing the `Announcements` repo__

1. Navigate to class [Announcements](https://github.com/USF-Psych-DataSci-2020/Announcements) repository.
2. Click `Watch` on the upper-right corner of the repo

You should now get an email notification whenever an Issue is posted.

### GitHub for version control with git (5 min)

GitHub uses a program called `git` to keep track of the project's history (more about `git` next Thursday).

- Users make "commits" to form a _commit history_.
- `git` only tracks the _changes_ associated with a commit, so it doesn't need to take a snapshot of all your files each time.
- The actual changes are called a _diff_.

Demostration:

- View commit history of the [STAT545-home](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-home) repository by clicking on the "commits" button on the repo home page.
- View a recent diff by clicking on the button with the _SHA_ or _hash_ code (something like `6c0a5f1`).
    - This is also useful for collaborators to see exactly what you changed.
- View the repository from a while back with the `<>` button.
- View the history of a file by clicking on the file, then clicking "History".

Why version control?

- Don't fret removing stuff
- Leave a breadcrumb trail for troubleshooting
- "Undo" and navigate a previous state
- Helps you define your work
- ...

### GitHub for version control with git - Activity (5 min)

__Your turn: History of the [`STAT545-UBC/Classroom`](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom) repository.__

1. Use the commit history of the [`STAT545-UBC/Classroom`](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom) repository to find Assignment 01 that was delivered last year in STAT 545A (Note: the course ended in mid October 2018, and the assignments were held in a folder called `assignments`). 
2. Add the URL of this assignment to your `navigating_github.md` file in your participation repository. Keep up with the commentary within the file, too. When was the assignment due? 

Note: These are not exactly the assignments you will be doing in this class.

## Topic 3: Asking effective questions online (10 min)

(5 min)

We all get stuck sometimes. If you try taking [preliminary measures](https://wiernik-datasci.netlify.com/help-general/) such as googling, you may have to turn to writing a question on a discussion board. Making your question _effective_ is an art. 

To make your question effective, the idea is to make things as easy as possible for someone to answer. 

- Will they have to dig to find a resource you're talking about, or do you provide links?
- If your code isn't doing what you expect, or you don't know how to obtain an output, do you provide a [__reproducible example__](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) (aka "reprex")?
  - Ideally, someone should be able to copy and paste a chunk of code to reproduce the problem you are talking about.
- Is your reproducible example _minimal_, meaning you've removed all the unnecessary parts to reproduce the problem?

You'll probably find that the act of writing an effective question causes you to answer your own question!

### Asking questions - Activity (5 min)

__Commenting on some online questions__

1. My turn: Start an Issue on the [Announcements repo](https://github.com/USF-Pssych-DataSci-2020/Announcements/issues) called `Asking effective questions`.
2. Your turn: Find a question/issue or two that someone has posed online. Check out [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for inspiration.
3. Your turn: Add a comment to the newly opened Issue with the following:
    - The URL to the thread/question
    - A few brief points on how the question is worded effectively or ineffectively. What would make it better, if anything?

We'll talk about some examples after you're done. 

# The version control workflow

The rest of today's topic is version control..

## Learning Objectives

From this lesson, you will be able to demonstrate the git/GitHub functionality listed here.

## Working with git and GitHub

Before we dive into concepts, it's important to distinguish between the __local__ 
and __remote__ copies of a repo.

- __Local__ refers to things on your own computer. A local repo is a repo found on your hard drive.
- __Remote__ refers to things on the internet. A remote repo lives on GitHub (or other similar sites). 

You can connect a local repo to a remote repo, then push and pull ("fetch") changes
between them. You have already been doing this using the GitHub Desktop program.

Note that you can connect your local repo to more than one remote repo! 
Because of this, git gives the remote repos names (e.g., `origin`, `upstream`). 
In this class, we will only ever be using one remote. By default, this remote is 
named __origin__. 


### The typical workflow (8 min)

The majority of your interaction with version control will be a 
**pull/stage/commit/push workflow**, explained here. For another resource on 
this, check out [happygitwithr: rstudio-git-github](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html).

0. __Clone__ your repository if you don't have a local copy.

Once you have a local copy of the repository, then working on a project involves 
frequent use of these three steps:

1. __Pull__ the remote repo to make sure your local copy is up to date.
2. Make changes to your files.
   1. __Stage__ your changes (GitHub Desktop does this for you).
3. __Commit__ your changes.
4. __Push__ the changes (after perhaps pulling again).

Git treats the remote repository as the "official" version of the repository. 
This means that your local copy is a second class citizen -- the repository you 
have locally must be up-to-date with the remote repository before you are 
allowed to push your work. If there are commits on the remote repository that 
are not present locally, git will throw an error if you try to push your changes.

**Integrate version control as you do work!**

Keep track of your changes by committing them frequently as you go, rather than
waiting until the end.

- Workflow without version control: save your files spontaneously.
- Workflow with version control: 
  - save your files spontaneously, 
  - commit your changes after every "step" in your work, and 
  - push your changes [in case of fire](https://github.com/louim/in-case-of-fire). 

Committing often ensures that you can trace back all the work you did. 
This results in transparency with the way your project has developed, 
which is a very effective workflow. 

You might feel self-conscious about half-finished work being viewable.
Try to push past that. Folks aren't going to judge you based on in-progress work.



### Git Clients (3 min)

We have been using the GitHub Desktop program ("client") to work with git. 
It's also possible to work with git directly from RStudio (see the bottom of this
page) or using other programs. You can also "directly" interact with git, by
typing commands in the terminal (cmd, Terminal, bash), such as `git clone`, 
`git commit`, etc. Working in the terminal opens a lot of extra functionality
with git, but the GitHub Desktop program will get us most of what we need.


### Merge conflicts (5 min)

If you change a file locally, and that same file (_and_ the same lines) get 
changed on the remote repo in a different way, you'll end up with a _merge conflict_.

You will need to resolve this conflict before you can continue working. Remember 
that your local copy is a second class citizen compared to the remote version, 
so you'll have to resolve things locally before pushing to the remote. 

### Merge conflicts: Activity (5 min)

Let's make a merge conflict, then fix it. 

1. Edit a line of your README both locally and remotely (on GitHub) to something 
   different in both cases. Commit both changes.
2. Try pulling your remote changes. You'll get a _merge conflict_. 
3. Update the file that has the conflict, commit your changes, and push.


### Branching (8 min)

Sometimes, it's a good idea to work on changes to one part of your code separately
before putting them back into your master document. For example, let's say you
want to experiment with a new analysis without messing up your existing work.

To do that, we use **branches**. A branch is a copy of the repo that sits separately
from your `master` branch. Git keeps track of how each of your branches differs.
  - When did a branch break off from `master`?
  - What commits have been made to the branch since the break?
  - What commits have been made to `master` since the break?
  
Let's take a look at some branches on the [psychmeta repo](https://github.com/psychmeta/psychmeta).

After you make changes to the branch, at some point, you probably want to **merge**
the branch back into `master`. On GitHub, we do this using a **pull request**.
  - That name means you want the parent branch (`master`) to _pull_ in all the 
    commits made on child branch. You _request_ that this happens from the 
    owners or collaborators on the repo (for your homework, this is yourself).
  - Once a pull request has been opened, it's a good time to review the changes
    to the code, run tests, make comments, and correct any errors. You can review
    yourself and also request code reviews from others by username.
  - You can make additional changes to the pull request by pushing more commits
    to the child branch.
  - When you are ready, **merge** the pull request into the parent branch.
  - [Example from psychmeta](https://github.com/psychmeta/psychmeta/pull/75).
  - For more info on pull requests, see this [GitHub tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

There are many reasons you may want to branch. Here are some:

- A collaborator wants to make a change to the repo, but the end product of the 
  change requires review from collaborators.
- You want to make changes, but don't want to "deploy" the changes until later 
  (such as if pushing to GitHub triggers a website build).
- If you want to try something "risky", it's just safer to work on a branch.

### Branching: Activity (5 min)

Let's organize our participation repo in a branch.

1. Create a new branch locally, called "organizing" (we could have also made this on GitHub):
    - Click the "Branch" button ![](./img/branch.png) in GitHub Desktop.
    - Type a name for your branch and click "New Branch".
2. Stage and commit the new files.
3. Restructure your repository in a more sensible way, using some folders (locally).
4. Stage and commit the changes; push to GitHub.
5. Explore: 
    - Switch between branches to see that the repo structure is different.
6. Merge the branch to "master" via GitHub by making a pull request. 


### Undoing Changes (5 min)

There are many ways that work can be "undone" in git. We will only investigate 
three of the simpler methods. For more advanced methods, like reverting to a specific
previous commit in your repo history, check out these resources by 
[bitbucket](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes) and 
[GitHub](https://blog.github.com/2015-06-08-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git/). 


The three most useful "undo"s are:

1. Undoing your (uncommited) work and reverting to the previous commit.
2. Reverting a single previous commit.
3. Browsing the repo at previous states, and taking files from there. 

We'll demonstrate (1) and (2) in an activity.

### Undoing Changes: Activity (2 min)

Here's how to go back to the most recent commit:

1. First, make and save a change to (say) a README file in your participation repo.
2. In GitHub desktop, right-click on the file whose changes you want to discard.
   Click "Discard Changes". You can even select multiple files at once if you like.
   
Here's how to undo a specific previous commit:

1. In GitHub desktop, click on the History tab.
2. Right-click on the commit you want to revert and choose "Revert this commit".


### Getting weird errors? (3 min)

It's common to sometimes experience some errors in git, especially if you're first 
learning how to use it. Try to get yourself unstuck with the concepts we've discussed here first. 

But, you might find yourself stuck. The git documentation is full of jargon, 
making it difficult to read and therefore difficult to debug things. There's even 
a [parody](https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/) on it. If you are in 
this position, it's best to just [burn it all down](http://happygitwithr.com/burn.html). 
There's even an [xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/1597/) on this.


### Tagging a Release (5 min)

Tagging a release on GitHub is like putting a "star" next to a particular commit. 
It highlights a particular point in time of your repository that is noteworthy, 
typically after achieving some milestone. This is easier to come back to than 
having to manually keep track of noteworthy points in your commit history.

Examples:

- At the end of teaching this class, I will tag a release so I can easily come back
  to earlier versions of the course in the future.
- After sufficient development of an R package like [psychmeta](https://github.com/psychmeta/psychmeta/releases), 
  a new release is tagged corresponding to the version of the package. 

### Tagging a Release: Activity (3 min)

Congratulations! We finished the first two weeks of DataSci and Programming, 
which focussed on _tools_. To mark this milestone, let's tag a release on our 
participation repositories.

1. On your GitHub repo online, click "Releases"
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Fill in the fields:
    - It probably makes sense to use a versioning system like `week_2` here.
4. "Publish Release".


## This week's homework

### Assignment

The assignment is posted on the [Assignments page](https://wiernik-datasci.netlify.com/evaluation/assignments/) 
of the course website.

Your tasks are to create 3 products:
  1. A README.md file for your homework repository to introduce yourself
     and show off some Markdown formatting skills.
  2. An RMarkdown document exploring a dataset, such as `gapminder::gapminder`
     or `psych::bfi`.
  3. An RMarkdown presentation that formats your dataset exploration as a set
     of slides instead a document.

- Follow the instructions in the HW01 description carefully. 
- Commit your code to your homework repo on GitHub **on a new branch called `hw01`**. 
- When you are ready for your peer review (by Monday at 23:59!), create a 
  **Pull Request** to prepare to merge this branch back into your `master` branch.
- Request code reviews from the 2 people assigned to you (see the 
  [Peer Review page](https://wiernik-datasci.netlify.com/evaluation/hw01/pr01/)).
- Submit your peer reivews to your classmat by Tuesday at 23:59.
- Merge your homework branch back into `master` and tag a release called `hw01` 
  by Wednesday at 23:59.


## Optional: Work with git in RStudio

It's possible to work with git/GitHub directly in RStudio, rather than using
GitHub Desktop. I usually work with GitHub Desktop, but do whatever works for you.
I can help you get RStudio working with git if you need a hand.

You might need to [configure your git](http://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html) 
using the command line or the `usethis` package.

Your RStudio will probably be able to "find" git. But if it can't, you'll 
encounter errors. See [happygitwithr: see-git](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-see-git.html) 
for help. 

__Optional__ (but recommended): If you are on a laptop, after class, you might 
want to [cache](http://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html) 
your credentials so that you don't have to keep inserting your password.

### The typical workflow git in RStudio

Let's make a change to our repository from local.  

1. Cloning your participation repo.
    - In RStudio, File -> New Project -> Version Control -> Git.
    - You should see a `Git` tab in RStudio, upper-right corner window. 
      If not, see [happygitwithr: see-git](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-see-git.html) 
      for help.
    - Take a look at the files you just downloaded!
2. Make your README a little nicer. Maybe fix up the title.
3. Stage and commit the changes:
    - In the Git tab in RStudio, click the checkboxes for the files that you 
      want to commit. This is called "staging".
    - Click the "Commit" button.
    - Enter a commit message.
    - Click "commit". 
4. Push to your remote repository (which is named "origin")
    - Click the up arrow in the Git panel in RStudio.

<!-- 
# Leftover text.

3. Commit your changes. 

Notice that GitHub automatically displays markdown files nicely, but not HTML files.

Note: this exercise employs an effective _local_ git workflow, which we will 
address later on in class.

Together:

1. If you haven't already, clone your participation repository to your desktop.
2. In RStudio, open the file `navigating_github.md`.
    - Yes! RStudio also acts as a plain text editor!
3. Convert the `.md` file to both pdf and html by clicking the `Preview` or `Knit` button.
4. Commit the two new files and push them to GitHub.
