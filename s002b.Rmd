# The version control workflow

The rest of today's topic is version control..

## Learning Objectives

From this lesson, you will be able to demonstrate the git/GitHub functionality listed here.

## Working with git and GitHub

Before we dive into concepts, it's important to distinguish between the __local__ 
and __remote__ copies of a repo.

- __Local__ refers to things on your own computer. A local repo is a repo found on your hard drive.
- __Remote__ refers to things on the internet. A remote repo lives on GitHub (or other similar sites). 

You can connect a local repo to a remote repo, then push and pull ("fetch") changes
between them. You have already been doing this using the GitHub Desktop program.

Note that you can connect your local repo to more than one remote repo! 
Because of this, git gives the remote repos names (e.g., `origin`, `upstream`). 
In this class, we will only ever be using one remote. By default, this remote is 
named __origin__. 


### The typical workflow (8 min)

The majority of your interaction with version control will be a 
**pull/stage/commit/push workflow**, explained here. For another resource on 
this, check out [happygitwithr: rstudio-git-github](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html).

0. __Clone__ your repository if you don't have a local copy.

Once you have a local copy of the repository, then working on a project involves 
frequent use of these three steps:

1. __Pull__ the remote repo to make sure your local copy is up to date.
2. Make changes to your files.
   1. __Stage__ your changes (GitHub Desktop does this for you).
3. __Commit__ your changes.
4. __Push__ the changes (after perhaps pulling again).

Git treats the remote repository as the "official" version of the repository. 
This means that your local copy is a second class citizen -- the repository you 
have locally must be up-to-date with the remote repository before you are 
allowed to push your work. If there are commits on the remote repository that 
are not present locally, git will throw an error if you try to push your changes.

**Integrate version control as you do work!**

Keep track of your changes by committing them frequently as you go, rather than
waiting until the end.

- Workflow without version control: save your files spontaneously.
- Workflow with version control: 
  - save your files spontaneously, 
  - commit your changes after every "step" in your work, and 
  - push your changes [in case of fire](https://github.com/louim/in-case-of-fire). 

Committing often ensures that you can trace back all the work you did. 
This results in transparency with the way your project has developed, 
which is a very effective workflow. 

You might feel self-conscious about half-finished work being viewable.
Try to push past that. Folks aren't going to judge you based on in-progress work.



### Git Clients (3 min)

We have been using the GitHub Desktop program ("client") to work with git. 
It's also possible to work with git directly from RStudio (see the bottom of this
page) or using other programs. You can also "directly" interact with git, by
typing commands in the terminal (cmd, Terminal, bash), such as `git clone`, 
`git commit`, etc. Working in the terminal opens a lot of extra functionality
with git, but the GitHub Desktop program will get us most of what we need.


### Merge conflicts (5 min)

If you change a file locally, and that same file (_and_ the same lines) get 
changed on the remote repo in a different way, you'll end up with a _merge conflict_.

You will need to resolve this conflict before you can continue working. Remember 
that your local copy is a second class citizen compared to the remote version, 
so you'll have to resolve things locally before pushing to the remote. 

### Merge conflicts: Activity (5 min)

Let's make a merge conflict, then fix it. 

1. Edit a line of your README both locally and remotely (on GitHub) to something 
   different in both cases. Commit both changes.
2. Try pulling your remote changes. You'll get a _merge conflict_. 
3. Update the file that has the conflict, commit your changes, and push.


### Branching (8 min)

Sometimes, it's a good idea to work on changes to one part of your code separately
before putting them back into your master document. For example, let's say you
want to experiment with a new analysis without messing up your existing work.

To do that, we use **branches**. A branch is a copy of the repo that sits separately
from your `master` branch. Git keeps track of how each of your branches differs.
  - When did a branch break off from `master`?
  - What commits have been made to the branch since the break?
  - What commits have been made to `master` since the break?
  
Let's take a look at some branches on the [psychmeta repo](https://github.com/psychmeta/psychmeta).

After you make changes to the branch, at some point, you probably want to **merge**
the branch back into `master`. On GitHub, we do this using a **pull request**.
  - That name means you want the parent branch (`master`) to _pull_ in all the 
    commits made on child branch. You _request_ that this happens from the 
    owners or collaborators on the repo (for your homework, this is yourself).
  - Once a pull request has been opened, it's a good time to review the changes
    to the code, run tests, make comments, and correct any errors. You can review
    yourself and also request code reviews from others by username.
  - You can make additional changes to the pull request by pushing more commits
    to the child branch.
  - When you are ready, **merge** the pull request into the parent branch.
  - [Example from psychmeta](https://github.com/psychmeta/psychmeta/pull/75).
  - For more info on pull requests, see this [GitHub tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

There are many reasons you may want to branch. Here are some:

- A collaborator wants to make a change to the repo, but the end product of the 
  change requires review from collaborators.
- You want to make changes, but don't want to "deploy" the changes until later 
  (such as if pushing to GitHub triggers a website build).
- If you want to try something "risky", it's just safer to work on a branch.

### Branching: Activity (5 min)

Let's organize our participation repo in a branch.

1. Create a new branch locally, called "organizing" (we could have also made this on GitHub):
    - Click the "Branch" button ![](./img/branch.png) in GitHub Desktop.
    - Type a name for your branch and click "New Branch".
2. Stage and commit the new files.
3. Restructure your repository in a more sensible way, using some folders (locally).
4. Stage and commit the changes; push to GitHub.
5. Explore: 
    - Switch between branches to see that the repo structure is different.
6. Merge the branch to "master" via GitHub by making a pull request. 


### Undoing Changes (5 min)

There are many ways that work can be "undone" in git. We will only investigate 
three of the simpler methods. For more advanced methods, like reverting to a specific
previous commit in your repo history, check out these resources by 
[bitbucket](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes) and 
[GitHub](https://blog.github.com/2015-06-08-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git/). 


The three most useful "undo"s are:

1. Undoing your (uncommited) work and reverting to the previous commit.
2. Reverting a single previous commit.
3. Browsing the repo at previous states, and taking files from there. 

We'll demonstrate (1) and (2) in an activity.

### Undoing Changes: Activity (2 min)

Here's how to go back to the most recent commit:

1. First, make and save a change to (say) a README file in your participation repo.
2. In GitHub desktop, right-click on the file whose changes you want to discard.
   Click "Discard Changes". You can even select multiple files at once if you like.
   
Here's how to undo a specific previous commit:

1. In GitHub desktop, click on the History tab.
2. Right-click on the commit you want to revert and choose "Revert this commit".


### Getting weird errors? (3 min)

It's common to sometimes experience some errors in git, especially if you're first 
learning how to use it. Try to get yourself unstuck with the concepts we've discussed here first. 

But, you might find yourself stuck. The git documentation is full of jargon, 
making it difficult to read and therefore difficult to debug things. There's even 
a [parody](https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/) on it. If you are in 
this position, it's best to just [burn it all down](http://happygitwithr.com/burn.html). 
There's even an [xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/1597/) on this.


### Tagging a Release (5 min)

Tagging a release on GitHub is like putting a "star" next to a particular commit. 
It highlights a particular point in time of your repository that is noteworthy, 
typically after achieving some milestone. This is easier to come back to than 
having to manually keep track of noteworthy points in your commit history.

Examples:

- At the end of teaching this class, I will tag a release so I can easily come back
  to earlier versions of the course in the future.
- After sufficient development of an R package like [psychmeta](https://github.com/psychmeta/psychmeta/releases), 
  a new release is tagged corresponding to the version of the package. 

### Tagging a Release: Activity (3 min)

Congratulations! We finished the first two weeks of DataSci and Programming, 
which focussed on _tools_. To mark this milestone, let's tag a release on our 
participation repositories.

1. On your GitHub repo online, click "Releases"
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Fill in the fields:
    - It probably makes sense to use a versioning system like `week_2` here.
4. "Publish Release".


## This week's homework

### Assignment

The assignment is posted on the [Assignments page](https://wiernik-datasci.netlify.com/evaluation/assignments/) 
of the course website.

Your tasks are to create 3 products:
  1. A README.md file for your homework repository to introduce yourself
     and show off some Markdown formatting skills.
  2. An RMarkdown document exploring a dataset, such as `gapminder::gapminder`
     or `psych::bfi`.
  3. An RMarkdown presentation that formats your dataset exploration as a set
     of slides instead a document.

- Follow the instructions in the HW01 description carefully. 
- Commit your code to your homework repo on GitHub **on a new branch called `hw01`**. 
- When you are ready for your peer review (by Monday at 23:59!), create a 
  **Pull Request** to prepare to merge this branch back into your `master` branch.
- Request code reviews from the 2 people assigned to you (see the 
  [Peer Review page](https://wiernik-datasci.netlify.com/evaluation/hw01/pr01/)).
- Submit your peer reivews to your classmat by Tuesday at 23:59.
- Merge your homework branch back into `master` and tag a release called `hw01` 
  by Wednesday at 23:59.


## Optional: Work with git in RStudio

It's possible to work with git/GitHub directly in RStudio, rather than using
GitHub Desktop. I usually work with GitHub Desktop, but do whatever works for you.
I can help you get RStudio working with git if you need a hand.

You might need to [configure your git](http://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html) 
using the command line or the `usethis` package.

Your RStudio will probably be able to "find" git. But if it can't, you'll 
encounter errors. See [happygitwithr: see-git](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-see-git.html) 
for help. 

__Optional__ (but recommended): If you are on a laptop, after class, you might 
want to [cache](http://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html) 
your credentials so that you don't have to keep inserting your password.

### The typical workflow git in RStudio

Let's make a change to our repository from local.  

1. Cloning your participation repo.
    - In RStudio, File -> New Project -> Version Control -> Git.
    - You should see a `Git` tab in RStudio, upper-right corner window. 
      If not, see [happygitwithr: see-git](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-see-git.html) 
      for help.
    - Take a look at the files you just downloaded!
2. Make your README a little nicer. Maybe fix up the title.
3. Stage and commit the changes:
    - In the Git tab in RStudio, click the checkboxes for the files that you 
      want to commit. This is called "staging".
    - Click the "Commit" button.
    - Enter a commit message.
    - Click "commit". 
4. Push to your remote repository (which is named "origin")
    - Click the up arrow in the Git panel in RStudio.
