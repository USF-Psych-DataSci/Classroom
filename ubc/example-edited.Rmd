Reversible R Markdown Document
------------------------------

This is an example Reversible R Markdown document.

You can use things like inline <!--- an HTML comment ---> comments and they will
be restored.

You can use code chunks to generate output and they will be
{== restored ==}{>> Neat! <<}:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Inline text
-----------

```{r, include= FALSE}
# A non-included chunk to provide inline chunks with values.
a <- 2
b <- 3
```

You can include calculations inline like so: `r a` plus
`r b` equals `r a + b`. Even empty inline
chunks `r NULL` will be stored and marked with hidden text in
the Word document.
