# (2) String theory: Working with character data

--- LAST YEAR'S CONTENT BELOW ---

## Agenda

Making sense of strings: how to deal with data of class `character`.

We'll be using the following data that ships with `stringr`, today's R package that comes shipped with `tidyverse`:

```{r}
str(stringr::fruit)
```

```{r}
str(stringr::words)
```

```{r}
str(stringr::sentences)
```

## Worksheet

To get participation points for today, we'll be filling out the cm102-exercise.Rmd file.
