## Welcome to R

Now, we'll get you up to speed with a minimum "need to know" about using R and 
RStudio. We're going to assume you know nothing and start from the basics. We will
explore more of the R/RStudio landscape as the semester goes on.

The format of today's notes aim to teach R by exploration, so is essentially an 
activity guide with prompts for exploration. These are mostly all exercises 
we'll be doing together in class. 


## Why R?

Why R? Some points taken from [adv-r: intro](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Introduction.html):

- Free, platform-wide
- Open source
- Comprehensive set of "add on" packages for analysis
- Huge community
- â€¦

Alternatives exist for data analysis, python being another excellent tool, 
especially these days as more and more R-like functionality is added to it. The 
good thing about python is that it's faster and has better support for machine 
learning models. 



## Rmd Presentations

You can also make presentation slides using Rmd. A great resource is Yihui's 
[Rmd book, "Presentations" section](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/presentations.html).

Some types of formats:

- ioslides
- [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1)
- [slidy](https://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/#(1))
- [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/)
- ...


### Activity: Exploring ioslides

Let's turn the file we've been working on into slides.

Together:

1. In RStudio, go to "File" -> "New File" -> "RMarkdown" -> 
   "Presentation" -> "ioslides". Explore!
2. Clear everything below the YAML header.
3. Copy and paste the tibble exploration we've been working on 
   (without the YAML header), and turn them into slides.
   
   
   
   
   
## Topic 3: Asking effective questions online (10 min)

(5 min)

We all get stuck sometimes. If you try taking [preliminary measures](https://wiernik-datasci.netlify.com/help-general/) such as googling, you may have to turn to writing a question on a discussion board. Making your question _effective_ is an art. 

To make your question effective, the idea is to make things as easy as possible for someone to answer. 

- Will they have to dig to find a resource you're talking about, or do you provide links?
- If your code isn't doing what you expect, or you don't know how to obtain an output, do you provide a [__reproducible example__](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) (aka "reprex")?
  - Ideally, someone should be able to copy and paste a chunk of code to reproduce the problem you are talking about.
- Is your reproducible example _minimal_, meaning you've removed all the unnecessary parts to reproduce the problem?

You'll probably find that the act of writing an effective question causes you to answer your own question!

### Asking questions - Activity (5 min)

__Commenting on some online questions__

1. My turn: Start an Issue on the [Announcements repo](https://github.com/USF-Pssych-DataSci-2020/Announcements/issues) called `Asking effective questions`.
2. Your turn: Find a question/issue or two that someone has posed online. Check out [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for inspiration.
3. Your turn: Add a comment to the newly opened Issue with the following:
    - The URL to the thread/question
    - A few brief points on how the question is worded effectively or ineffectively. What would make it better, if anything?

We'll talk about some examples after you're done.
