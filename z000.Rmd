## Welcome to R

Now, we'll get you up to speed with a minimum "need to know" about using R and 
RStudio. We're going to assume you know nothing and start from the basics. We will
explore more of the R/RStudio landscape as the semester goes on.

The format of today's notes aim to teach R by exploration, so is essentially an 
activity guide with prompts for exploration. These are mostly all exercises 
we'll be doing together in class. 


## Why R?

Why R? Some points taken from [adv-r: intro](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Introduction.html):

- Free, platform-wide
- Open source
- Comprehensive set of "add on" packages for analysis
- Huge community
- â€¦

Alternatives exist for data analysis, python being another excellent tool, 
especially these days as more and more R-like functionality is added to it. The 
good thing about python is that it's faster and has better support for machine 
learning models. 



## Rmd Presentations

You can also make presentation slides using Rmd. A great resource is Yihui's 
[Rmd book, "Presentations" section](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/presentations.html).

Some types of formats:

- ioslides
- [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1)
- [slidy](https://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/#(1))
- [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/)
- ...


### Activity: Exploring ioslides

Let's turn the file we've been working on into slides.

Together:

1. In RStudio, go to "File" -> "New File" -> "RMarkdown" -> 
   "Presentation" -> "ioslides". Explore!
2. Clear everything below the YAML header.
3. Copy and paste the tibble exploration we've been working on 
   (without the YAML header), and turn them into slides.
